            <h3>Annotation</h3>
            <p3>
              The first interactive function of Youtube is Annotation.
              <strong>From 2008 to 2017</strong>, users were able to add
              "annotations" to movies, such as pop-up text messages and
              hyperlinks. These functions are explicitly used as the basis for
              interactive visuals, which use hyperlinks to other visuals to
              implement branching elements. <strong>In March 2017</strong>, it
              was announced that the Annotation's editor was being discontinued
              and that the feature would be phased out due to its plummeting
              usage, user boredom, and incompatibility with the mobile version
              of the service. <strong>On January 15</strong>, 2019, all comments
              in the film were completely removed. <br /><strong

            <h4>Streaming</h4>
            <p4>
              With the rise of online video and audio platforms, network
              broadcast is a form of entertainment in which instant images are
              broadcast publicly on the Internet. Webcast is still most commonly
              used in rebroadcasting entertainment-related content, in which the
              host performing or hosting the webcast is generally called the
              streamer.
              <br />
              <br />
              The concept of webcast originated from Justin.tv, which began to
              explore the feasibility of technologies related to personal
              webcast in 2007 and later transformed into Twitch, which focuses
              on the real-time broadcast by capturing players' game images.

            <p3>
              Following Twitch's live-streaming trend, YouTube has been showing
              videos that call themselves "live" since 2012.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, in practice, some films were only broadcasted through
              post-production, rather than real-time means such as
              live-streaming or online streaming. The creators who uploaded
              these films could only be considered YouTubers or gamers, not
              streamers. In late 2015, the social networking site Facebook also
              made streaming available. At the same time, Douyu TV and Panda TV
              also rose in mainland China. In the early stage, users can
              directly broadcast live from mobile devices (such as smartphones
              and tablet computers), and in the later stage, they can also
              broadcast live on computers.
              <br />
              <br />
              YouTube quickly adapted to the trend of mass communication. The
              most significant difference between streaming and uploading their
              videos is that viewers can interact with the anchor in real-time
              by leaving messages. The anchor can adjust the program content or
              please the audience according to the audience's response.
