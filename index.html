            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p3>
              YouTube, currently the second most visited website in the world,
              is a video site that provides an easy way for ordinary computer
              users to upload videos. With the development of technology,
              broadband and the popularization of photographic equipment, short
              film information is very popular. With its simple interface,
              YouTube allows any video uploaded to the network to be watched by
              the world audience in a few minutes. This enables netizens to
              change from traditional information receivers to information
              publishers.

              Netizens can set up their own private theaters, video publishing
              stations, and news stations. The rise of video sites has largely
              played the role of broadcast media's next leader, and YouTube as
              the most influential video site shows us how online media is about
              to become the new mainstream media.

            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p3>
              Over the course of YouTube's rise, it has gone through numerous
              optimization updates. By learning and adapting popular models from
              other online social platforms, YouTube has also added many new
              features to its website, including ads, membership, streaming,
              real-time chat room (interaction), YouTube Shorts, etc. Since
              2005, it has taken ten years of evolution for YouTube to become at
              the top of the industry today. Let's see how YouTube became a
              success in the new era of communication media.

                <p>
                  YouTube was founded by Chad Meredith Hurley, Steve Chen and
                  Jawed Karim.

                <p>
                  Co-founder Karim released a 19-second video titled "Me at the
                  Zoo." It was the first video on YouTube and the starting point
                  for YouTube to become a milestone in the development of
                  Internet culture in the 21st century. The Los Angeles Times
                  commented on the film: "As the first video uploaded to
                  YouTube, it played a pivotal role in fundamentally changing
                  the way people use media and ushering in a new golden age of
                  one-minute shorts" . As of November 23, 2021, "I'm at the Zoo"
                  has been viewed 200 million times and left 11.01 million
                  comments. Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion in
                  stock.

                  World Wide Web, with 4,000 short videos and beyond 6 million
                  visitors a day. It was ranked as the fifth most popular
                  website by Alexa, even surpassing MySpace's growth rate at the
                  time. YouTube automatically recommends videos to its users,
                  and as of early 2019, 70% of the videos its users watched came
                  from automated recommendations. YouTube makes full use of the
                  advantages of video and audio media, covering entertainment
                  music, social networking, popular culture, film and
                  television, games, education, publicity and other markets, and
