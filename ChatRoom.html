            <h5>YouTube Changed In Streaming</h5>
            <p5>
              YouTube quickly adapted to the trend of mass communication. The
              most significant difference between streaming and uploading their
              videos is that viewers can interact with the anchor in real-time
              by leaving messages. The anchor can adjust the program content or
              please the audience according to the audience's response.

            <h4>Function Improve</h4>
            <p4>
              In 2022, YouTube launched a new live Q&A feature to enhance
              channel owners' interaction with viewers, and the "key chat
              messages" feature will filter out suspected spam content, making
              the picture clearer and easier to read.
              <br />
              <br />
              The channel owner only needs to click "Initiate question and
              Answer activity" in the plus icon of the chat room, which is in
              the live broadcast control center. Then, input the subject content
              to initiate question and answer activity to the audience.
              <br />
              <br />
              Questions posted by viewers will be listed in the chat room, and
              the streamer will be able to place the question at the top of the
              chat room by pressing the three-point menu icon next to the
              question of interest. Streamer repeats these steps to select a new
              question, while switching to a new topic or ending Q&A requires
              clicking on the question to close Q&A.
              <br />
              <br />
              YouTube believes that "Live Q&A" enables channel owners to
              interact with viewers and discuss topics that are of interest to
              the audience, which helps to deepen relationships and expand the
              community.

            <h3>Chat Room Culture</h3>
            <p3>
              Live "chat rooms" are one of the ways that Youtubers could
              interact with their viewers. On YouTube live, chat rooms can be
              opened or closed at the discretion of the live host, and a single
              inappropriate remark can be removed, or a time limit can be added
              through the delete function.
              <br />
              <br />
              YouTube also offers an optional "replay chat room message"
              feature, which allows later- comers to drag and drop the timeline
              of the film to relive discussions in the chat room. In addition,
              the live host can also designate the chat room manager, sharing
              the pressure to maintain order of the audience.
