            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p3>
              YouTube Shorts is a new function that was launched by YouTube in
              2020. It allows users to create and upload short videos with a
              maximum of 60 seconds. It is a function that the similar to other
              popular video platforms such as TikTok and Instagram Reels.
              Because the short video platform has the characteristics of
              sliding, it is easy for users to watch new videos continuously,
              and it is easy to attract traffic. It attracts many Youtuber to
              make YouTube Shorts with clips of their video or new content to
              attract new audiences.

            <h4>Do YouTube Shorts copy TikTok?</h4>
            <p4>
              Actually, TikTok is the video platform that first sparked the
              trend of short videos. When YouTube Shorts do not yet come out,
              TikTok has already over 1 billion active users and become the most
              popular video platform in the world. And TikTok became the biggest
              threat to youtube at that time, so Youtube launched Youtube shot
              to compete with it. In fact, most of the videos on Youtube Shorts
              are carried from TikTok, which shows that TikTok is still the
              mainstream short video creation platform.

            <h5><img src="image/icon1.png" class="icon" />Editing tools:</h5>
            <p3>
              Both platforms provide editing tools and effects to create short
              videos, but TikTok also includes effects and filters which let
              user can produce more creative and attractive videos.

            <h5><img src="image/icon2.png" class="icon" />Commercialize:</h5>
            <p3>
              Creators not only can earn money through profit from videos, but
              also has many ways for creators to make money, such as
              sponsorship, brand cooperation, live streaming, etc. Although
              YouTube shorts have a profit system, it is not perfect.

            </h5>
            <p3>
              TikTok is a short video platform originally, the audiencebases are
              users of short videos. Therefore, the audience base willbe more
              willing and fond of watching. On the contrary, YouTube is a video
              platform that mainly focuses on live streaming and long-form
              videos originally. So the adding function of Shorts would be
              controversial for the audience.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p4>
              In order to compete with the short video platforms that have
              emerged in recent years, Youtube has added Youtube Shorts.
              Although it is still inferior to TikTok in many aspects. However,
              Youtube still has the characteristics of a wide range of
              functions, and short videos are already widely popular all over
              the world. In the future, the development of Youtube Shorts will
              become more mature and bring more users to Youtube.
